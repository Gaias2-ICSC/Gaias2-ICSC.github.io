# About GAIAS2

GAIAS2 is an acronym for "Generative Artificial Intelligence for Air Shower Simulation"

The aim of the project is to study the usage of _Generative Adversarial Networks_ to produce simulations of cosmic ray air showers

## Activities

GAIAS2 is subdivided into 4 activities

- A) Definition of the benchmarks quantities in the simulation of cosmic ray air showers: click <a href="benchsim"> here </a>
- B) Comparison between benchmark simulations: click <a href="simcomp"> here </a>
- C) Definition of the air shower model: click <a href="easmodel"> here </a>
- D) Generation of cosmic ray air showers with Generative Adversarial Networks, and comparison with benchmark simulations: click <a href="gangen"> here </a>
