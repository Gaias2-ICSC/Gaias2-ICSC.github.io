# Deliverable B

The main goal of Activity B is to verify that CORSIKA7 and CORSIKA8 simulations provide similar outputs. It should be recalled that at the moment, CORSIKA8 is not yet at a stable release, and as such should not be yet used in a real analysis scenario. It is in any case relevant


## Literature

Several comparisons between CORSIKA7 and CORSIKA8 have been provided by the authors, and are available in conference proceedings. The most complete collection has been published in the ICRC2021 proceedings, grouped together <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11761">here</a>. Additional comparisons have been made public at the ICRC2023 conference, as for example shown in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05475">these proceedings</a>.

## Current comparisons

A summary of comparisons between simulations with CORSIKA7 and CORSIKA8 obtained with the GAIAS2 productions described in the <a href="../benchsim">simulation benchmarks</a> and in the <a href="../compsim">simulation comparison</a> pages are available on <a href="https://github.com/Gaias2-ICSC/compsim">github</a>. A global agreement is found in the distributions of particles on ground and their distributions.
